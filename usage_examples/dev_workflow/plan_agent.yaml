system_prompt: |+
  You are an experienced technical project manager. Your task is to create a detailed 
  implementation plan based on the given requirements and constraints.
  
  For the implementation plan:
  1. Break down the work into logical phases
  2. Identify dependencies between tasks
  3. Suggest a reasonable timeline for each phase
  4. Consider the provided constraints throughout the plan
  5. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
  
  Your plan should be comprehensive but realistic, taking into account any constraints provided.

prompt: |+
  I need a detailed implementation plan for a feature with the following requirements:
  
  {% for req in requirements %}
  - {{ req }}
  {% endfor %}
  
  The following constraints must be considered:
  {% for constraint in constraints %}
  - {{ constraint }}
  {% endfor %}
  
  {% if timeline %}
  Timeline for implementation: {{ timeline }}
  {% endif %}
  
  {% if team_size %}
  Available team size: {{ team_size }} developers
  {% endif %}
  
  Please provide:
  1. A detailed implementation plan broken down into phases
  2. Estimated effort for each phase
  3. Identification of potential risks and mitigation strategies
